# Employee Tracker

## Description
This employee tracking application allows users to view and manage departments, roles, and employees of their company. 

Upon starting the application, the user will be able to choose if they want to view a table, or update an existing table. 

If the user selects to view all departments, a table will be displayed presenting the different departments.

If the user selects to view all roles, a table will be displayed presenting each roles title, salary, and department id.

If the user selects to view all employees, a table will be displayed presenting each employees first name, last name, role id, and manager id. 

The user may also choose to add a department, role, or employee if they'd like, and they could also update an existing employees role. 

## Future Development
  - Add functionality to prompt user for input (including the ability to update tables)
